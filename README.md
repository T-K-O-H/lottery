# 🎰 Powerball Lottery Number Analyzer

A comprehensive Python toolkit for analyzing Powerball lottery data using advanced statistical methods, machine learning, and pattern recognition techniques.

I have not won the lottery yet or even gotten $2 back LOL so just have fun with it. I'm going to keep adding nonsense and analysis to this hopefully something sticks.

Just remember that hot/cold etc it doesnt matter numbers are random. It's just for entertainment and maybe some hope.... we all need a little hope here and there.

Best of luck! and if you win don't forget about me!!!

If theres enough interest I'm considering making this into a nice working web app that's free to use.

- **Number 36** - Heat Index 89.4 (160 appearances)
- **Number 39** - Heat Index 89.4 (160 appearances)
- **Number 21** - Heat Index 83.6 (156 appearances)

### Coldest Numbers (Heat Index 0-30)
- **Numbers 60-69** - All in FREEZING category
- **Number 65** - Heat Index 0.0 (78 appearances)
- **Number 60** - Heat Index 0.0 (81 appearances)

### Statistical Insights
- 28.4% of draws contain consecutive numbers
- Average sum of white balls: 167.9
- Most common pattern: 2 even, 3 odd numbers (33.1%)
- Two distinct draw clusters identified via machine learning

## 🎯 Generator Strategies

### Hot Strategy
Favors historically hot numbers (23, 36, 39, 21)

### Cold Strategy
Favors historically cold numbers (contrarian approach)

### Balanced Strategy
Mix of hot, cold, and neutral numbers

### Position-Based Strategy
Uses historical position preferences

### Frequency-Weighted Strategy
Uses actual historical frequencies

### Random Strategy
Pure random selection (baseline)
